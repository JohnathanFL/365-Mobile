# CSIS 365 Assignment 2 – Java Basics (20 pts)


Create a Java program which does the following:

- Uses a method called createMenu which accepts a list of strings and returns a string. When the returned string is printed from the calling method, a menu is displayed as shown below:
    - Add New Employee – asks user to enter an employee name - should NOT allow duplicates
    - Delete Employee –should print a message if the employee doesn’t exist
    - Change Employee Name – should print a message if the employee doesn’t exist
    - Print Employee Roster
    - Quit 
- Creates methods for each of the options shown (addEmp, delEmp, chgEmp, printEmp)
- Continuosly prints the menu until the user chooses the Quit option.

Bonus Opportunities:

+2 Make sure the user’s choice is valid (test for letters, punctuation, etc.)
+2 Print a mini-menu when the user chooses Delete or Change which shows a numbered list of the employee names, allowing the user to select a number rather than typing a name.
